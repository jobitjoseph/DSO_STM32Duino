DSOSTM32Duino

This is a very work-in-progress project to write a firmware for the DSO shell, using STM32duino as a basis.

It uses my port of arduino-stm32-cmake as a build system

It is very early, dont expect it to work AT ALL.


Status so far:
* Screen ok (with ST7789, unsure about ILI9341)
* Rotary encoder ok (rewired to RX1/TX1)
* Micro USB port used a serial Ok

Come back in 6 months
