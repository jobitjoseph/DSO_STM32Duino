DSO_STM32Duino

This is a very work in progress to write a firmware for the DSO shell using STM32duino as a basis

It uses my port of arduino-stm32-cmake as a build system

It is very early, dont expect it to work AT ALL.

The current stage is to get the screen properly working
Then button & rotary encoder
then actual capture
